The Intel Edison Connectivity Framework (IECF) allows one Edison to discover and communicate with other Edisons.
Additionally, IECF allows an Edison to conveniently publish its data to the cloud and enables other Edisons to
subscribe to that data. The IECF is a library that comes pre-installed on the Edison board in
two flavors: C and node.js.

This documentation focuses on the NodeJS version of the library. To begin developing Edison applications and plugins
 please {@tutorial start-here}.

 #### Notes:

* API documentation is under the "Modules" and "Classes" section on the right
* Sample apps are documented and should be a great way to start for this release
* {@tutorial cloud} support is in its infancy and maybe unstable.
* Tutorials and high-level documentation is incomplete, but coming soon
